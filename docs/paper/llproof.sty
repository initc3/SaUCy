% Line-by-line proofs.
%
% Provides an environment `llproof', which is really a 4-column `tabular'
%  with 5 logical categories.  Generally, a line has the following form:
%
%    LHM  \Pf{LeftOfTurnstile}{Turnstile}{RightOfTurnstile}{Justification}
%
% LHM is used for left-hand marginalia (e.g. \Hand, or labelling a particular line);
% the \Pf macro fills in the rest of the line.
%
% ``Turnstile'' is often indeed \entails (or ``\vdash'', if you aren't me), but is really
%  for whatever ``axis'' you want the lines to line up on.  For sequences of foo |-- bar
%  judgments, that's the |--.  For sequences of, say, equalities and set inclusions,
%  you want to line up the = and \subseteq.
%
% ``LeftOfTurnstile'' and ``RightOfTurnstile'', then, appear to the left and right of the turnstile.
%
% ``Justification'' is really the whole point; it's a required argument.  Nothing stops you
% from writing {} for the justification, but you will (or should) feel uncomfortable when you do!
% (I often write {XXX} here when using ``the power of wishful thinking'', or when I know
% there's a lemma I can use, but don't want to break my flow by looking for it.)
%
% I said that the tabular environment underlying llproof has 4 columns, yet we seem
% to have 5 columns: LHM, LeftOfTurnstile, Turnstile, RightOfTurnstile, and Justification.
% In fact, LeftOfTurnstile and Turnstile---while semantically distinct in my mind---share
% a single column of the tabular environment.  I did this so that ``turnstiles'' of different
% widths in the same proof would look better: if one ``turnstile'' is much wider than the others,
% its extra width would cause a lot of extra space around the other ``turnstiles''.
%
% My intent was always that judgments in llproof should look as much like regular judgments,
% that is, judgments outside llproof (for example, in inference rules);
% the extra space would wreck that.
%
% Note that the definition of \Pf ends with \\, so anything put after the end of \Pf
%  will appear on the next line (becoming part of the next line's ``LHM'').
%
% Having said all that, in general, you shouldn't use \Pf directly.  For each kind of statement
%  you want to include in a proof, you should declare a macro for it.
% For example, we often talk about elements being contained \in sets, so:
%
%   \newcommand{\inPf}[3]  {\Pf{#1}{\in}{#2}{#3}}
%
% If you're the kind of person who likes to declare a macro for every judgment form,
%  you just need to declare a second macro for use in llproof, with one extra argument
%  for the Justification.  For example, if you already have
%
%   \newcommand{\typeof}[3]{{#1} \entails {#2} : {#3}}
%
% you could just add
%
%   \newcommand{\typeofPf}[4]{\Pf{}{}{\typeof{#1}{#2}{#3}}{#4}}
%
% This works OK, but your contexts and turnstiles won't line up.
% So you probably want, instead,
%
%   \newcommand{\typeofPf}[4]{\Pf{#1}{\entails}{{#2} : {#3}}{#4}}
%
%
%
% Formatting macros:
%
%   \proofsep --- Add some space (but less than an entire blank line).
%      Good for setting off logical ``blocks'' within a proof.
%
%   \decolumnizePf --- Ends the current llproof and starts another.
%     Sometimes a very wide part of a column on one line makes the proof too wide,
%      so it doesn't fit on a page.  \decolumnizePf makes the proof look less nice,
%      but it's better to look less nice than to run off the edge of the page.
%
% Macros independent of whatever particular judgments you have:
%
%   \LetPf{#1}{#2} --- Renders as ``Let #1 = #2.''  The arguments are in math mode.
%      Example:  \LetPf{x}{y + 1}
%
%   \supposePf{#1} --- Renders as ``Suppose #1.''  The argument is in math mode.
%   \contraPf{#1}  --- Renders \Rightarrow\Leftarrow, then \Pf{#1}{}{}{By contradiction}
%                      on a second line.  (Often acts as a closing delimiter for \supposePf.)
%
%   \trailingjust{#1} --- Renders a line that's blank except for #1 as the Justification.
%      Good for justifications that are too wide to fit on one line.
%
% Equations:
%
%   \eqPf{L}{R}{Just} --- Renders as ``L = R   Just'', with = as the ``turnstile''.
%   \eqPfParen{L}{R}{Just}  --- Renders as ``(L) = (R)  Just''.
%   \eqPfParenL{L}{R}{Just}  --- Renders as ``(L) = R  Just''.
%   \eqPfParenR{L}{R}{Just}  --- Renders as ``L = (R)  Just''.
%
%      (There's a good argument to be made that \eqPfParen should be the default,
%      and \eqPf should be \eqPfRaw or something.  The braces in the TeX source
%      seem to subconsciously suggest that the rendered output will have clear delimiters,
%      but it doesn't; for a bad time, write \eqPf{X = Y}{X = id(Y)} {id is the identity function}.)
%
%   \continueeqPf{R}{Just}  --- Renders as `` = R  Just'', e.g.
%
%        \eqPf{X}{Y}   {By above equation}
%        \continueeqPf{Y'}   {By \Lemmaref{lem:i-like-to-prime-Y}}
%
%   \rightstarteqPf{R}{Just}  --- Renders as ``    R  Just''.  Good for animals that are
%      so long that a line only fits one of them.
%      If you \rightstarteqPf, the next line must be \continueeqPf.
%
% Local macros, which don't generate an entire line:
%
%   \ditto  --- Renders as ditto marks.  I use this in the ``Justification'' when, say,
%          applying a single lemma gives several judgments as output.
%          (I *never* use it when I am repeatedly applying a lemma or repeatedly applying
%          the induction hypothesis, but that's really a matter of taste.)
