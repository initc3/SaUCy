\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The universal composability (UC) framework is widely used in cryptography to
demonstrate that a protocol ``does its job securely.'' Unfortunately, analysis
is traditionally done informally and on paper, so proofs of security often do
not instill within us the confidence we desire.

In this work, we have taken the first steps towards putting UC on a proper
footing by building a concrete, executable implementation of the framework
called SaUCy. We set apart our work from previous work in a major way: We
implement SaUCy in a newly designed process calculus called the Interactive
Lambda Calculus (ILC). Importantly, ILC faithfully abstracts interactive Turing
machines, the computational model underlying UC, which grants the compelling
benefit of computational security analysis. \todo{Finish later.}
