  The universal composability (UC) framework is
  the established standard for analyzing cryptographic protocols in a
  modular way, such that security is
  preserved under concurrent composition with arbitrary other protocols.
  However, although UC is widely used for on-paper proofs,
  % its modularity benefits are not widely used for analyzing implementations.
  prior attempts at systemizing it have fallen short,
  either by using a symbolic model (thereby ruling out computational reduction proofs),
  or by limiting its expressiveness.

  In this paper, we lay the groundwork for building a concrete, executable
  implementation of the UC framework. Our main contribution is a process
  calculus, dubbed the Interactive Lambda Calculus (ILC). ILC
  faithfully captures the computational model underlying UC---interactive Turing
  machines (ITMs)---by adapting ITMs to a subset of the $\pi$-calculus through its
  type system. In other words, \emph{well-typed ILC programs are expressible as
  ITMs.} In turn, ILC's strong confluence property enables reasoning about
  cryptographic security reductions.
  We use ILC to develop our implementation of UC, called SaUCy.
  To demonstrate the use of SaUCy, we work through an instantiation
  of UC-secure commitments from the literature, define a composition
  operator and proving its associated theorem, as well as examine
  a subtle definitional issue involving race conditions.
