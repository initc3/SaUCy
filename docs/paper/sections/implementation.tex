\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We have implemented a prototype of ILC in Haskell. Our implementation supports
the core calculus features (with an ML-like concrete syntax) described in this
paper, as well as pattern matching (with guards) and Hindley-Milner type
inference. Using ILC, we have written a standard prelude, a SaUCy-specific
prelude (the UC experiment along with useful functions), and a library of
various ideal functionalities.
