\section{Testing Security and Liveness with Byzantine Failures}
\label{sec:testing}

We will develop fuzz testing techniques aimed at identifying differences between
protocol implementations and their ideal functionality specifications (i.e.,
detecting violations of emulation between real and ideal protocols). While
existing work on fuzz testing distributed protocols has largely focused on
detecting safety violations in the presence of crash-stop failures, the scope of
our work will additionally encompass detecting liveness violations in the
presence of Byzantine failures. For instance, given a protocol, functionality
and simulator description in ILC, our tool will be able to test whether the
real protocol under attack by an injected adversary, who can arbitrarily corrupt
parties and choose event schedules, emulates the ideal protocol under attack by
the simulator. In order to scale Byzantine fuzz testing, we will identify
\emph{adversary schemas}, which can be used to automatically generate test cases
for exercising adversarial patterns that are likely to result in security and
liveness violations.
