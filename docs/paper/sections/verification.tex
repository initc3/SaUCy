\section{Mechanized UC Proofs}
\label{sec:verification}

Traditional cryptographic proofs require pervasive reasoning about
probabilities, which is typically at odds with the compositionality of program
logics, but UC allows us to reason about protocol components
independently~\cite{chong2016report}. Taking advantage of this compatibility, we
will develop a proof assistant for constructing and verifying machine-checked
security proofs in the UC model. Given a protocol, functionality, and simulator
description written in ILC, the verifier will be able to prove emulation
between the real and ideal protocols using a probabilistic Relational Hoare
Logic (pRHL)~\cite{barthe2011computer}. As an initial step, it may be useful to
bootstrap from existing tools that support probabilistic reasoning, such as
EasyCrypt~\cite{barthe2011computer} and \fstar~\cite{swamy2016dependent}, by
compiling ILC into their languages. However, because neither of these tools
natively support the simulation-based reasoning used in UC proofs, our end goal
is to tailor our tool to UC-style reasoning. Importantly, our tool will use
theorem provers and SMT solvers in combination, allowing the verifier to provide
assistance for proof obligations that exceed the capabilities of SMT solvers.
