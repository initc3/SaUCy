Symbolic UC~\cite{bohl2016symbolic} adapts the UC framework, which is defined in
the context of computational model of cryptography, to the symbolic model. In
particular, they show that certain aspects of the UC framework, such as ideal
functionality specifications and UC composition, still carry over to the
symbolic model. They are also able to show that certain results, such as the
impossibility of UC commitments in the standard model of cryptography, can still
be observed in the symbolic model.

%, in which cryptographic operations are abstracted
